1. Introduce yourself

   “Hi, my name is Hitesh Dalvi. I have 3.3 years of experience as a Software Developer, specializing in cross-platform mobile development and front-end engineering using React Native, React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Redux, and Google Apps Script.

Currently, I’m working at Homeville Group as an SDE2, where I’ve been responsible for building and maintaining two fintech applications — HomeBuild Fieldforce and Singularity Build World. These applications streamline the home loan process from application to disbursal, used by both customers and internal teams.

In these projects, I’ve developed critical features such as payment gateway integration, Firebase push notifications, secure data storage, crash analytics, and performance monitoring. I also handle end-to-end deployment to the App Store and Play Store, ensuring a smooth release process.

Beyond delivering features, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and optimizing app performance. My contributions have improved responsiveness and reduced API latency, resulting in a more reliable and crash-free user experience.

I’m now looking forward to contributing my expertise to new challenges and building scalable, impactful mobile solutions with your team.”
